    "response": "The problem you have given is a simple arithmetic addition problem. Here's how we can think through it step by step:\n\n1. Identify the numbers to be added: In this case, the numbers are 2 and 2.\n   \n2. Add the numbers together: Addition is the process of combining quantities. When you add the two numbers together, you sum their values.\n\n   \\[\n   2 + 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. Verify the result: We can double-check our work by visualizing or using other methods such as counting on fingers or drawing two sets of two objects and counting them all together. Both methods will lead us to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer to 2 + 2 is 4.",
